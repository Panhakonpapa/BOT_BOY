# BOT BOY

Battery Eater is a simple game built using SDL where you, as a bot, must eat batteries to stay alive while avoiding enemies.

## Gameplay

In Battery Eater, you control a bot navigating through a dynamic environment filled with batteries and enemies. The objective is to survive as long as possible by consuming batteries while dodging the enemies. Each battery eaten contributes to your score, while encountering an enemy decreases your health. The game ends when your health reaches zero.

## Features

- **Simple Controls:** Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the bot.
- **Dynamic Environment:** The game environment is dynamic, with batteries and enemies appearing randomly.
- **Scoring System:** Gain points by eating batteries, with the score displayed in real-time.
- **Health Mechanic:** Your bot's health decreases upon colliding with an enemy and increases upon consuming a battery.
